This project involves the design and implementation of a university course management database system. It manages student enrollments, course information, and program data while maintaining consistency through SQL views, functions, and constraints. The system ranks students based on course performance, enforces prerequisite checks, and supports program and course enrollments with integrity via foreign keys and validation rules.
